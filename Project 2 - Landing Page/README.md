# Landing Page Project

## Overview

This project requires me to build a multi-section landing page, with a dynamically updating navigational menu based on the amount of content that is added to the page.

I build it based on the starter project provided by Udacity, which has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. I convert the starter project from a static project to an interactive one. This requires modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.


## Project Rubric
Some key rubrics include
- All files shown must be present and the app must successfully render a home page with clear design and functionality added when index.html is loaded in the browser. No errors should display in console.
- All features are usable across modern desktop, tablet, and phone browsers.
- Styling has been added for active states.
- There are at least 4 sections that have been added to the page.
- Navigation is built dynamically as an unordered list.
- It should be clear which section is being viewed while scrolling through the page.
- When clicking an item from the navigation menu, the link should scroll to the appropriate section.
