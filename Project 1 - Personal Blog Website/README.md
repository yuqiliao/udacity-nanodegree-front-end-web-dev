# Personal Blog Website Project

## Overview
This project requires me to utilize my HTML and CSS skills to build out a personal blog website from scratch (unlike my [current personal blog website](https://www.yuqiliao.com/) that is built using a [static site generator](https://gohugo.io/)), including custom images, layout, and styling. Along with webpage design considerations, I'll work to appropriately structure files, as well as use proper CSS and HTML formatting & style.


## Project Rubric
Some key rubrics include
- Custom images, layout, and styling.
- Uses Flexbox at least twice throughout the project to create a component or pattern
- Uses CSS Grid at least twice throughout the project to create the layout for pages
- Pages are mobile-friendly and display correctly on all display sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).
- HTML5 semantic tags such as `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, etc. are used to add meaning to the code.
