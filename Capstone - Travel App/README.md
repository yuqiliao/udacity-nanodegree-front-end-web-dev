# Capstone - Travel App

## Overview

This project requires me to create a basic travel planning web app that uses multiple Web APIs. The project includes a simple form where you enter the location you are traveling to and the date you are leaving. If the trip is within a week, you will get the current weather forecast. If the trip is in the future, you will get a predicted forecast. 

The Geonames API is used to get the coordinates from the location entered, which is then feed to the Weatherbit API to get weather data. The Pixabay API are used to display an image of the location entered.
