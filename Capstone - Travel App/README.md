# Capstone - Travel App

## Overview
This project requires me to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI. It's my first dive into [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).

## Project Rubric
Some key rubrics include
- Create API credentials on OpenWeatherMap.com.
- There should be a GET route setup on the server side with the first argument as a string naming the route, and the second argument a callback function to return the JS object created at the top of server code.
- There should be an asynchronous function to fetch the data from the app endpoint
- You should be able to add an entry to the project endpoint using a POST route setup on the server side and executed on the client side as an asynchronous function. The client side function should take two arguments, the URL to make a POST to, and an object holding the data to POST.The server side function should create a new entry in the apps endpoint (the named JS object) consisting of the data received from the client side POST.
- Adds an event listener to an existing HTML button from DOM using Vanilla JS. In the file `app.js`, the element with the id of generate should have an `addEventListener()` method called on it, with `click` as the first parameter, and a named callback function as the second parameter.
- Sets the properties of existing HTML elements from the DOM using Vanilla JavaScript. Included in the async function to retrieve that appâ€™s data on the client side, existing DOM elements should have their `innerHTML` properties dynamically set according to data returned by the app route.
